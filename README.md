## 📌 Milestones

### Milestone 1: Project Setup
**✅ Goals:**
- Created and updated `README.md` file.
- Initialized GitHub repository for version control.

---

### Milestone 2: Frontend & Backend Initialization
**✅ Goals:**
1. **Project Folder Structure:** Organized files into separate `frontend` and `backend` directories.
2. **React Frontend Setup:** Initialized a React application for building the user interface.
3. **Node.js Backend Setup:** Set up a simple Node.js server for API integration in future milestones.
4. **Tailwind CSS Configuration:** Integrated and configured Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive styling.
5. **Login Page Development:** Created a login page with functionality and styling.

---

### Milestone 3: Backend Structure & Server Setup
**✅ Goals:**
1. **Backend Folder Structure:** Created a structured hierarchy for organizing routes, controllers, models, and middleware.
2. **Server Setup:**
   - Used Node.js and Express.js to create a backend server.
   - Configured the server to listen on a designated port.
3. **Database Connection:**
   - Integrated MongoDB for efficient data storage.
   - Confirmed the connection between the server and MongoDB.
4. **Error Handling:**
   - Provided clear error messages for better debugging and user feedback.

---

### Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller
**✅ Goals:**
1. **User Model:** Defined the structure of user data with attributes like `name`, `email`, `password`, and `profile picture`.
2. **User Controller:** Handled user-related actions such as registration and data retrieval.
3. **Multer Integration:** Enabled file uploads for storing user profile pictures.
4. **API Routes:** Created endpoints for user creation and fetching user details.
5. **README Update:** Documented progress and updated repository.

---

### Milestone 5: Sign-Up Page & Form Validation
**✅ Goals:**
1. **Sign-Up Page UI:** Designed a clean and user-friendly sign-up form with fields for `name`, `email`, and `password`.
2. **Form Validation:**
   - Ensured the email follows the correct format.
   - Implemented password security criteria (minimum length, special characters, etc.).
3. **User Registration Flow:** Integrated frontend form submission with the backend API.
4. **Error Handling:** Displayed validation errors to users in real-time.
5. **README Update:** Documented progress and updated repository.

---

### Milestone 6: Secure User Registration
**✅ Goals:**
1. **Password Encryption:**
   - Used bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
   - Ensured no plaintext passwords are stored.
2. **Secure Data Storage:**
   - Stored the user's encrypted password along with other necessary details in MongoDB.
3. **Updated API Endpoints:**
   - Modified the user registration endpoint to handle password hashing securely.
4. **Security Compliance:**
   - Followed best practices for protecting user credentials.
   - Complied with security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.
5. **README Update:**
   - Documented progress for Milestone 6 and updated the repository.

---

### Milestone 7: User Login & Authentication
**✅ Goals:**
1. **Login Endpoint:**
   - Created a backend endpoint for user login, accepting email/username and password.
   - Retrieved user data from MongoDB based on the provided email/username.
   - If the user does not exist, returned an error: "User does not exist."
2. **Password Validation:**
   - Utilized bcrypt to compare the entered password with the stored hashed password.
   - Ensured password verification was secure and efficient.
3. **Authentication Flow:**
   - If the hashed passwords matched, authenticated the user.
   - If not, sent an error indicating invalid credentials.
4. **Security Considerations:**
   - Implemented secure password handling without storing plaintext passwords.
   - Complied with security standards such as GDPR and PCI-DSS.
5. **README Update:**
   - Documented the progress and learning outcomes for Milestone 7.
   - Updated the repository with details about the user login functionality.
